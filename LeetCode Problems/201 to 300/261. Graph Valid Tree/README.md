## 261. Graph Valid Tree

### Question

Given ```n``` nodes labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` and a list of ```undirected``` edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), 
<br>write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: true.
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
